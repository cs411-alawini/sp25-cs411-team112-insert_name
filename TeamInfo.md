## Project Summary

GreenChain Insights is a web application that enables users to explore greenhouse gas emissions data across different industry sectors, with a focus on NAICS code classifications. Through an interactive dashboard interface, users can analyze emissions data and simulate the impact of their own purchases, providing both broad industry-level insights and personalized carbon footprint calculations. The platform serves as a comprehensive tool for understanding emissions patterns and their relationship to individual consumer choices.

The system's strength lies in its ability to combine historical industry data with personal impact simulations, creating a bridge between macro-level emissions data and individual decision-making. Users can explore detailed breakdowns of emissions by sector, conduct advanced searches based on various parameters, and generate personalized scenarios to understand the environmental impact of their purchasing decisions.
