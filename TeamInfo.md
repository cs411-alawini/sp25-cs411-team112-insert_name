## Project Summary

GreenChain is a web application that enables users—logistics managers, sustainability analysts, or curious consumers—to explore how different industries and product categories contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. By leveraging a detailed dataset of GHG emission factors (mapped to NAICS industry codes) and a large supply chain operational dataset, the platform highlights the carbon footprint associated with the movement and sale of goods.

At its core, the system calculates carbon footprints in multiple ways: from the raw emission factors tied to each industry category to real shipping data that includes late-delivery risk, shipping durations, and order-level details. Users can search for specific product categories, compare emission metrics across industry sectors, and gain actionable insights into how supply chain decisions—such as switching categories or optimizing shipping schedules—might reduce overall carbon impact.
